    Most \emph{Voice over IP} service providers create home-grown tools to manage their systems. As their needs, and their customer's demands, grow, their toolset falls behind and becomes a pain point for their company. A system built to grow with millions of users in mind must be conceived to be scalable from start, and that scalability can be achieved by relying on a distributed architecture. Complexity is abstracted in the Cloud, therefore hidden from the end-user.
