I would like to thanks Dr.~Christopher Leeds, my supervisor and business communication teacher, and the Dominican University of California for having me as a foreign student in its certificate program.\\

An internship begins by being accepted in a company. 2600hz gave me a lot, from a personal and a professional perspective. James Aimonetti and Karl Anderson were supportive and taught me. Without them this experience would not have been so enriching.
